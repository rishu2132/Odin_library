## [29.01.26]

- Right now , while applying DOM to my dialog box I was stuck as it was not closing after submitting and I tried other methods but it was not closing . I tried everything but I wasn't able to fix the problem , so while scrolling the code I saw CSS applied directly to dialog and thought let's see if it has an effect and Yes, that was the key due the CSS directly applied to the dialog element it started working like normal element.

- So don't apply CSS directly to dialog tag, either apply through dialog[open] or to form.
